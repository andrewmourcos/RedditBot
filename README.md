# RedditBot
Test for a bot that comments on reddit posts containing a trigger word

Using python Praw module, my bot connects to a reddit account, searches for comments containing
a mispelled version of the word 'Massachusetts' and makes a comment to suggest a different spelling (which
is also mispelled). It currently runs on a semi-reliable server on r/bottest. Good luck on your own bots!
